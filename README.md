Cited Source Code (Camera2Video, RecognizerIntentActivity)
------------

This source code is a modification of Google's [Camera2Video][1] sample application, for use
with speech recognition and GPS location tracking.

Additional code for the voice detection in RecognizerIntentActivity.java is based on tutorials by 
[wangkuifeng0118][http://blog.csdn.net/wangkuifeng0118/article/details/7251813] and [AndroidHive][http://www.androidhive.info/2014/07/android-speech-to-text-tutorial/].

GPS Location code was created using the [android.location API framework][https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/package-summary.html]. 


Gradle
---------------

This code, like the Camera2Video sample, uses the Gradle build system. To build it, use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
